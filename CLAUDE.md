Knows about Tailwind CSS integration, path aliases, and the components.json configuration file structure.

### 2. shadcn-component-expert ‚úÖ
**Status:** Implemented  
**Purpose:** Deep knowledge of all 50+ shadcn components, their Radix UI foundations, proper composition patterns, and advanced usage scenarios. Understands the copy-paste philosophy and how to extend components effectively.

### 3. shadcn-theming-specialist ‚úÖ
**Status:** Implemented  
**Purpose:** Expert in CSS variables system, color theory, dark mode implementation, and brand integration. Knows how to work with the HSL-based color system and create accessible, cohesive visual designs.

### 4. shadcn-form-builder ‚úÖ
**Status:** Implemented  
**Purpose:** Specializes in React Hook Form integration, Zod validation schemas, complex form layouts, multi-step forms, dynamic form generation, and form accessibility. Understands shadcn's form components ecosystem and validation patterns.

### 5. shadcn-dashboard-architect ‚úÖ
**Status:** Implemented  
**Purpose:** Expert in building admin dashboards, data tables, charts integration (Recharts), layout patterns, responsive design for data-heavy interfaces, and complex navigation structures using shadcn components.

### 6. shadcn-accessibility-auditor ‚úÖ
**Status:** Implemented  
**Purpose:** Deep understanding of WCAG guidelines, ARIA patterns, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, color contrast requirements, and how Radix UI primitives provide accessibility foundations.

### 7. shadcn-animation-specialist ‚úÖ
**Status:** Implemented  
**Purpose:** Expert in Framer Motion integration, CSS animations, page transitions, loading states, micro-interactions, and performance optimization for animated shadcn components.

### 8. shadcn-data-visualizer ‚úÖ
**Status:** Implemented  
**Purpose:** Specializes in integrating shadcn with data visualization libraries (Recharts, Chart.js, D3.js), creating custom chart components, dashboard widgets, and interactive data presentations.

### 9. shadcn-mobile-optimizer ‚úÖ
**Status:** Implemented  
**Purpose:** Expert in mobile-first design, touch interactions, responsive breakpoints, mobile navigation patterns, and PWA integration with shadcn components.

### 10. shadcn-performance-auditor ‚úÖ
**Status:** Implemented  
**Purpose:** Focuses on bundle size optimization, code splitting, lazy loading strategies, component performance profiling, and build optimization for shadcn-based applications.

### 11. shadcn-testing-engineer ‚úÖ
**Status:** Implemented  
**Purpose:** Specializes in testing shadcn components with Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright, visual regression testing, accessibility testing, and component testing strategies.

### 12. shadcn-migration-specialist ‚úÖ
**Status:** Implemented  
**Purpose:** Expert in migrating from other UI libraries (Material-UI, Chakra UI, Ant Design) to shadcn, component mapping strategies, code transformation scripts, and gradual migration approaches.

## Agent Architecture

Each sub-agent has:
- **Extensive domain knowledge** in their specialized area
- **Deep understanding** of shadcn's philosophy and design principles
- **Integration patterns** with popular frameworks and libraries
- **Real-world implementation experience** and best practices
- **Seamless collaboration** capabilities with other agents

## Key Features

### üéØ **Specialized Expertise**
Each agent provides deep domain knowledge in their specific area, ensuring expert-level guidance for all aspects of shadcn/ui development.

### üîÑ **Seamless Integration**
Agents work together cohesively - the installer sets up projects, the form builder creates complex forms, the accessibility auditor ensures compliance, and the performance auditor optimizes results.

### ‚úÖ **Validation-First Approach**
Every agent includes comprehensive validation guidelines with:
- **DO's**: Best practices and recommended patterns
- **DON'Ts**: Anti-patterns and common mistakes to avoid
- **Checklists**: Step-by-step validation processes

### üõ†Ô∏è **Production-Ready Code**
All examples include:
- TypeScript types and interfaces
- Error handling and edge cases
- Accessibility considerations
- Performance optimizations
- Testing strategies

### üì± **Modern Development Practices**
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Progressive Web App features
- Core Web Vitals optimization
- CI/CD integration
- Automated testing pipelines
